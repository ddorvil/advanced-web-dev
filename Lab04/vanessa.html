		<p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Rochester pursing a Bachelor’s degree in Language, Media, and Communications (or English, in simpler terms). I’ve essentially spent my entire life in Rochester as I was born and grew up here. After obtaining my Bachelor’s degree, I plan on attending the Warner School of Education here at UR to get a Master’s in Education. My career goal is to become a secondary English teacher, and I would really love to teach at an RCSD school, which is where I attended both elementary and high school. Aside from English, I’m also very interested in Computer Science, Studio Art and Gender Studies, which I have been able to explore more through classes here at UR. </p>

		<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
			
				  <p> Outside of school I spend a lot of time with my new puppy that I got over the summer, making digital art, and also work a retail job at Greece Ridge Mall. I absolutely hate Python because it’s just not as fun as html.
				  I’ve learned about early cinema, read some interesting medieval texts
				  I was also hired as a tutor for young children at LEAP which has been the best job I’ve ever had, and made me feel like I was already getting some teaching experience. I also applied for about 15 on-campus jobs, got interviewed for most of them, but didn’t get any of them, so I spent fall 2018 very broke.</p>
