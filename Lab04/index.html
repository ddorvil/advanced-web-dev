				Each professor that teaches a course in the CS department were required to pick at least three high performing students to represent their course. These three students, Joshua Wolkoff, Maria Mancheno, and Vanessa Acevdeo were specifically picked by Robert Kostin for their elustrious work ethic in their work. In addition to being showcased on the website, they will be receiving a monetary award, Robert M. Kostin Excellence Award of $2,500.00.
